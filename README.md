# d3_fers
A walkthrough of NSW Functional Economic Regions (FERs) with some simple ABS population data, using D3 and scrollama. 

Maps are tricky to work with in static visualisations, especially in a state like NSW where Sydney is extremely dense but also extremely small relative to the size of the rest of the state, so the map's just a sea of white with a deep blue on the coast for the Metro LGAs. 

I wanted to use scrollama and D3 to explore other ways to represent geographic data, in particular using the zoom and filtering functionality of D3.

Index file is a modified version of the scrollama <a href="https://russellsamora.github.io/scrollama/sticky-side/">sticky side example</a>.
